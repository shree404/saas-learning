                <p>
                Moving from Nepal to Australia and studying here as an international student is likely to be <br /> overwhelming. Therefore, being prepared for the standard of living is necessary, and this includes <br /> understanding the costs involved. There are mainly three areas that you will have to consider while <br /> gathering and segmenting your finances for your study stay in Australia. <br /><br />
                Let’s take a look at the fees you have to pay for admission in a university, the possible scholarship <br /> opportunities that you can avail, and the cost of living you may have to incur. <br /><br />
                <span className="font-bold ">The fee structure for studying in Australia</span> <br /><br />
